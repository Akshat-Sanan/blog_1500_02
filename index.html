            <time>18th November 2022</time>
            <p>Automatic technologies such as Tesla's electric cars had blew the world at one point, where using sensors around the car, they can sense the surroundings and self drive, even without a driver. And now Quantum Sensors!</p>
            <p>We cannot imagine the potential a quantum tech can hold, just like a quantum computer. Imagine a sensor acheiving extreme accuracy in sensing-to the scale down to atoms, this could change the world of sensors.</p>

            <time>2nd December 2022</time>
            <p>Even though providing internet via light seems limited, but the strength, bandwidth and especially the security of the network would be much more than the traditional wifi network </p>
            <p>Imagine companies or resturants making only certain physical areas to be only wifi accessable. </p>

            <time>2nd December 2022</time>
            <p>This is by far one of the most simple yet most complex car invention. Car that changes color, easy to think, but very complex to build such. </p>
            <p>And BMW did it! Having a feature to just change the color of car in a click is so useful and amazing. Imagine a black color car under hot sunny day, no worries, just change the whole exterior to white color in an intsance. </p>
